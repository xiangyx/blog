støvsugning is a noun meaning “vacuuming”.

**Decomposition**

støv = dust

suge = to suck

-ning = noun ending (turns a verb into an action/process)

**Step by step**

støv (dust)

suge → sug (verb stem: suck)

støvsuge = to vacuum (literally “to suck dust”)

støvsugning = vacuuming (the act of vacuuming)

So literally:

støvsugning = dust-sucking 🧹

This -ning ending is super common in Danish:

rengøre → rengøring (clean → cleaning)

male → maling (paint → painting)

vaske → vask / vaskning (wash → washing)

“Bestil tid nu” means:

👉 “Book an appointment now” / “Schedule a time now”

Word by word

bestil = order / book

tid = time / appointment

nu = now

In Danish ads and websites, “bestil tid” is a very common phrase for:

booking an appointment (doctor, hairdresser, cleaner, service, etc.)

So the tone is a call to action, like:

Book now! ⏰

“Møbler gives væk.” means:

👉 “Furniture given away.”
(or more natural: “Furniture is being given away for free.”)

Word by word

Møbler = furniture

gives = is given

væk = away

This is a very common phrase in Danish ads / notices, especially on Facebook or in stairwells. It strongly implies free (no payment expected).

You might also see:

“Gratis møbler” = free furniture

“Gives bort” = given away (same meaning as gives væk)

“Til afhentning” = for pickup

The Danish passive with -s

In “Møbler gives væk”, the verb gives is in the passive form.

How it works

Danish often forms the passive by adding -s to the verb:

at give = to give

gives = is given

So:

Jeg giver møblerne. = I give the furniture.

Møblerne gives. = The furniture is given.

Very similar to English passive, but much shorter.

Why Danish uses it so much

The -s passive is super common in:
- ads
- notices
- rules & instructions
- signs

It sounds neutral, impersonal, and efficient.

Examples you’ll see a lot:
- Sælges = for sale
- Udlejes = for rent
- Lejes = wanted to rent
- Åbnes kl. 9 = opens at 9
- Lukkes kl. 17 = closes at 5

“væk” in this context

væk literally means away, but with passives it often implies removal / no longer wanted.

- gives væk = given away (free)
- smides væk = thrown away

Natural English meaning

So “Møbler gives væk” is basically:

🪑 Free furniture — come take it.
