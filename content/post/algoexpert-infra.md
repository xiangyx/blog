## Networking

### Protocol

A protocol is a set of rules for formatting and processing data. It defines how data is transmitted over a network.

### Network

A network is a collection of devices that can communicate with each other. It can be as simple as two computers connected by a cable or as complex as the internet. Think of it as an undirected graph where nodes are devices and edges are connections.

### Data Link Layer

This layer is the protocol that transfers data between nodes on a network across the physical layer. It is responsible for node-to-node data transfer and error detection and correction.
